          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The Shree Chanakya Education Society (SCES) was established in
            February 1994, under the visionary leadership of Dr. Tarita Shankar,
            with the aim of providing top quality post-graduate education in the
            Ô¨Åelds of Business Management, International Business and Information
            Technology. By consistently providing quality education over the
            past few decades, institutes at Indira Group are now considered as
            some of the best in Pune.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            At a time when India was struggling to put its economy back on its
            feet, Dr. Tarita Shankar sensed that education too would have to
            become more broad-based and more vocational in nature if India was
            to stand up to global competition. Thus, in 1994, began a saga of
            growth and quality education ‚Äî a story that continues with 14 full
            Ô¨Çedged Institutes making a strong presence in Pune's educational
            landscape.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Since inception, the Institutes managed by SCES have maintained high
            academic standards and have successfully provided trained manpower
            to the industrial and services sector of the country.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            With a modest strength of 60 students pursuing a single course, SCES
            has grown steadily and today boasts of 14 Institutes with over 8000
            students from across India pursuing multi-disciplinary programs.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-10">
            The objective of the institute is to provide 'Management education
            in a corporate environment', which has been possible due to the
            sincere and dedicated efforts of the SCES members, who bring
            invaluable experience from varied sectors.
